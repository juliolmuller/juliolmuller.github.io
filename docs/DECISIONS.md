# Decisions

The "why" behind the current architecture ([ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) is the "what"). Ids are **stable**: code comments, tests and docs cite them (`D37`, `D56`…). Never renumber.

**Format.** context → decision → consequence, kept to the part a future change must respect. Superseded entries stay as one line pointing at their replacement; the long reasoning lives in git history (`git log -p docs/DECISIONS.md`, last full version at `7ea54f1`). New decisions get the next id (D69+) and are added under the matching topic. Status: **active**, **superseded**, **amended**.

Resolved against npm and the docs bundled in the published packages on 2026-10-13; majors are pinned with `^`, exact versions come from `bun.lock`.

## Toolchain and versions

- **D5 — TypeScript 6.0, not 7.0** (active). `typescript-eslint@8.71` peers on `<6.1` and `eslint-config-next` depends on it. Pin `~6.0.3`; revisit when typescript-eslint supports 7.
- **D6 — ESLint 9, not 10** (active). `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.10.2` peers on ESLint ≤ 9 and jsx-a11y strict is required. `bun run update` re-pins both after `bun update --latest`.
- **D15 — Dependency build scripts** (superseded by D24). Bun blocks lifecycle scripts by default; `trustedDependencies: []`. The three blocked (`@parcel/watcher`, `@swc/core`, `unrs-resolver`) have prebuilt optional binaries. Add an entry only when a package fails without its script.
- **D20 — Prettier** (active). Single quotes, trailing commas, 80 columns, semicolons, LF (the owner's editor default is CRLF, but the repo lives in WSL/Linux and CI is Linux; `.gitattributes` enforces it), Tailwind plugin.
- **D24 — Bun 1.4 as package manager and Vercel runtime** (active; replaced pnpm). `vercel.json`: `bunVersion: "1.4.x"`, `bun install --frozen-lockfile`. `dev/build/start` run `bun run --bun next …` (required for ISR on Vercel's Bun runtime). Repo scripts run `bun --conditions=react-server scripts/*.ts` (resolves `server-only` to its no-op). Node 24 stays for tools that spawn `node` (ESLint, Vitest, Playwright). `audit:deps` ignores GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm (`braces`, dev-only via `eslint-config-next` → `fast-glob`, no patched release); remove the ignore when one ships. **Risk:** Bun runtime on Vercel is beta and the proxy likely stays on Node; if ISR or `sharp` misbehave, drop `bunVersion`.

## Rendering, routing, i18n

- **D1 — Cache Components** (superseded by D1b).
- **D1b — Classic ISR** (active). Cache Components streamed `200` for unknown slugs and a client-side redirect for `previousSlugs`. So `cacheComponents` is off; routes use `revalidate = 86400`, `dynamicParams = true`, `generateStaticParams`; Sanity reads use `fetch` with `next.tags`; `unstable_cache` is not used. Fixtures have no fetch, so admin writes call `updateTag` **and** `revalidatePath`. Verified: `/en/projects/nope` → 404, `/en/projects/old-alpha` → 308. Migrating later needs a slug check in the proxy.
- **D2 — `next/root-params`, not `setRequestLocale`** (active). `[locale]` is the root segment with its own `<html lang>`; `src/i18n/request.ts` reads the locale from root params; typed messages via `AppConfig`. Two root layouts (public, admin). Server Actions and Route Handlers can't read root params: pass the locale explicitly.
- **D3 — URL policy and the indistinguishable 404** (active). The proxy invokes next-intl only for `/` (307: cookie → `Accept-Language` → `en`). Any other unprefixed path, and anonymous `/admin/**` (GET, POST, Server Action posts, `/admin/api/upload`), is a real 404 from the same global page with identical body and headers (an e2e diffs them). Multipart POSTs to a page are treated by Next as Server Action attempts (400 for every path).
- **D16 — View Transitions** (superseded by D62).
- **D18 — Locale negotiation in the proxy, not next-intl middleware** (active). `src/i18n/negotiate.ts` (pure, tested); `Vary: Accept-Language, Cookie`, `private, no-store`; next-intl runs with `localeCookie: false`, `localeDetection: false`. The cookie is written only by the language switcher. Without JS the switch works but nothing is remembered.
- **D19 — Global 404 is `global-not-found.tsx`** (active; `experimental.globalNotFound`). The proxy rewrites any path whose first segment isn't a locale or known root file (including anonymous admin) to `/404`; `[locale]/[...rest]` calls `notFound()` for localized 404s.
- **D33 — Invalid project query params are 404s** (active). Unknown `?kind=`, non-positive `?page=`, empty kinds and pages past the end → 404, so soft-404 URLs never enter the index.
- **D34 — Project filter is link navigation** (active). No Motion layout animation: cards stay Server Components wrapping the `Tilt` island; the live region announces the count.
- **D35 — `/projects` is request-rendered** (active). Awaiting `searchParams` makes it dynamic (`ƒ`); first hit after a deploy pays a render, then 24 h cache.
- **D57 — Precompiled messages** (active). next-intl `experimental.messages` precompiles ICU at build (~8 KB gzip off first load). Read messages through a translator, never raw JSON; `global-not-found.tsx` uses `createTranslator`; scripts under Bun still read source JSON.
- **D62 — Card → detail cover morph** (active). `CoverTransition` wraps the cover in React `<ViewTransition name="project-cover-<slug>" share="project-cover" default="none">`; only shared pairs animate; each slug at most once per page; CSS kills the pseudo-elements for reduced motion / Pause animations. `<html data-scroll-behavior="smooth">` is required so Next disables smooth scrolling during route changes (without it the pair never formed). Plays only if the detail page is prefetched.

## Content and Sanity

- **D7 — `@sanity/client`, no `next-sanity`** (active). `next-sanity` peers on Studio/styled-components for features we don't use. No live preview (not needed: admin saves publish at once).
- **D8 — Sanity client settings** (amended by D26). `useCdn: false`, `perspective: 'published'`, pinned `apiVersion` (default `2026-10-01`), tokens from env, built in `server-only` modules.
- **D9 — Revalidation APIs** (active). Server Actions: `updateTag` for every affected tag (+ `/sitemap.xml`). Webhook: `revalidateTag(tag, { expire: 0 })`. "Revalidate all" updates every `content:*` tag. Single-arg `revalidateTag` is deprecated; don't use it.
- **D14 — Fixture images and PDFs are generated and committed** (active). `scripts/generate-fixtures.ts` is deterministic (seeded by slug), writes `public/fixtures/{images,pdf}` plus `src/lib/content/fixtures/assets.generated.ts` (dimensions, 20 px LQIP, sizes). WebP q82 only (`next/image` makes AVIF); 13 images + 2 PDFs ≈ 129 KB. Authored keys (`profile-photo`, `profile-photo-lg`, D47) encode from committed masters and are never SVG-regenerated.
- **D25 — One content pipeline, two thin sources** (active). See ARCHITECTURE. A technology edit invalidates `content:technologies` only. A test asserts deep equality of every repository method across adapters.
- **D26 — Sanity reads over plain `fetch`** (amends D8). `src/lib/content/sanity/http.ts` calls the HTTP query API with a Bearer Viewer token, `cache: 'force-cache'`, `next: { revalidate: 86400, tags }`; errors carry the status only. Long GROQ stays in the URL (≤ 1.5 KB today; Sanity asks for POST above 11 KB).
- **D27 — Adapter contract-tested offline with `groq-js`** (active). `tests/support/sanity-memory.ts` converts fixtures into storage documents (the seed's own converter), synthesizes asset docs and evaluates the real GROQ. Remaining gap (hosted engine, auth header, asset pipeline) is covered by `content:smoke` after seeding.
- **D28 — Storage shape and ids** (active). `localeString/Text/Markdown` `{en,pt}`; `_key` = sha1 of path; technology references; images with localized alt and hotspot; slugs `{current}`; singleton `_id` = type; seeded ids `<type>.<sha1-derived>`, admin-created ids plain UUIDs (nothing depends on the format). Dotted ids are "path ids" hidden from the public API — moot on a private dataset.
- **D29 — Studio schema as plain data, deployed through MCP/API** (active). `sanity/schema.ts` has no `sanity` dependency; the same declaration is deployed to both datasets as workspace `default`; validation stays in zod; a unit test fails if a converted fixture field is missing from the schema. Extended by D65.
- **D30 — Datasets and seeding** (active). Project `njcnsmax`: private `production` (real) and `development` (fictional seed). `sanity:seed` uses `createOrReplace` in one transaction, refuses `production` without `--force`, `--reset` deletes only `isFixture == true` after typing the dataset name, `--dry-run` converts only.
- **D53 — Admin write path** (active). `AdminStore` / `AdminService` split, optimistic concurrency, revalidation, signed webhook (`sanity-webhook-signature` = `t=<ms>,v1=<base64url HMAC-SHA256 of "<t>.<body>">`, 10-minute tolerance, rate-limited, anything invalid is a bare 404), fixtures writable outside production (`ADMIN_FIXTURE_WRITES=1` for e2e only), `proxyClientMaxBodySize: 5mb`, `serverActions.bodySizeLimit: 2mb`. In fixtures mode public HTML regenerates lazily (seconds); the uncached terminal snapshot shows edits at once. Reorders renumber `order` to 10, 20, …
- **D65 — Studio-ready schemas** (active; extends D29). `sanity/studio.ts` exports `studioSchemaTypes` (previews, "Display order" orderings, `validation` built from the zod field schemas via a two-method structural `Rule`) and `singletonTypes`. Cross-field/cross-document rules aren't repeated. Studio-created docs get random ids the admin can't open (D55). Setup in SANITY.md.

## Security and admin

- **D4 — CSP: static policy for public pages, nonce for admin** (active). Nonces force dynamic rendering and break PPR; experimental SRI can't cover inline RSC flight scripts under ISR. Public: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self'; style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; manifest-src/worker-src 'self'; upgrade-insecure-requests` (`'unsafe-eval'` in dev only). Admin: `'nonce-…' 'strict-dynamic'` for scripts, nonce for styles. Mitigation for `'unsafe-inline'`: zero third-party origins, no user HTML, sanitized Markdown, escaped JSON-LD. Revisit when Next supports hashes for flight data.
- **D10 — Upload transport** (active; limits changed by R3). Files go only through `POST /admin/api/upload` returning an asset reference; Server Actions never carry binaries and keep `bodySizeLimit`. **Limits are now 4 MB for images and PDFs** (Vercel's 4.5 MB body cap) and a missing `Content-Length` gets 411 (commit `3b4199c`).
- **D11 — Hosting: Vercel, not GitHub Pages** (active). The spec needs a proxy, Server Actions, Route Handlers and on-demand revalidation. The repo keeps its historical name; GitHub Pages config from the old site must go when the domain moves.
- **D70 — Production domain is `juliolmuller.com`** (active; replaces the launch-URL assumption of `juliolmuller.vercel.app`). The original plan launched on the free `*.vercel.app` name and left a custom domain for later. `juliolmuller.com` is now the Production domain and the value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, with DNS hosted at Hostinger. `www.juliolmuller.com` and every other `*.vercel.app` alias, including `juliolmuller.vercel.app`, redirect to it (308); `lacus.solutions` and `www.lacus.solutions` redirect to it (307); only `next-juliolmuller.vercel.app` (branch `next`) stays unredirected as staging. Consequence: canonicals, sitemap, OG URLs, HSTS and the `__Host-` cookie follow the new origin, so the admin session of the former origin doesn't carry over (sign in again) and Search Console and Bing need the new property.
- **D21 — Inline motion-init script** (active). The persisted "Pause animations" choice must apply before first paint. React 19.3 rejects `<script>` created during client rendering. One constant IIFE (`src/lib/motion-init.ts`) is injected with `useServerInsertedHTML` from a client leaf returning `null`; `<html suppressHydrationWarning>`. Second (with JSON-LD) exception to the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` rule.
- **D51 — Admin access** (active). Fixed `/admin`; proxy gate; extra `ses` claim so the 8-hour cap survives renewals; renewal at most once a minute, never for Server Action posts; cookie `__Host-jm_session` (+`Secure`) when the site URL is https else `jm_session` (tied to the URL, not `NODE_ENV`, so `next start` over http works in e2e/WebKit); `ADMIN_PASSWORD` HMACed with `SESSION_SECRET` and compared in constant time, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (`scrypt:N:r:p:salt:hash`, no `$`) wins; admin disabled unless `SESSION_SECRET` ≥ 32 chars and a password/hash exists (production: password ≥ 16); rate limiter interface with an in-memory default (Upstash **not** built); admin-only headers set by the proxy only on the allowed branch (a `next.config` rule would leak the path through anonymous 404s); `/admin` forced dynamic by reading cookies first.
- **D52 — Terminal secret commands** (active). `secret/names.ts` (three names) is the only secret code in the public chunk; the rest loads on demand; public chunks must contain neither `Authentication failure` nor `/admin` (e2e scans scripts). `su` accepts any target, always prompts, native `type="password"`, paste OK, `Ctrl+C` cancels; success hard-navigates to the returned `redirectTo`. Without a session `admin`/`logout` are byte-identical to unknown commands. Server is the authority (`getSessionStatus()` on mount/focus). The command names being readable in the chunk is accepted: secrecy is UX, not security.
- **D54 — Uploads and sanitizers** (active). See ARCHITECTURE. Fixtures mode runs the full pipeline then assigns a placeholder asset with the real dimensions.
- **D55 — Admin UI structure** (active). One dynamic tree (`/admin/[area]`, `/new`, `/[id]`) driven by `areas.ts` / `area-config.tsx`; URLs carry only the uuid part of ids (the proxy lowercases URLs and ids have capitals); shared editor fields (`LocalizedField`, Markdown editor with safe preview, image field with focal point, list editor with up/down + drag, icon pickers); dirty guard, error summary, conflict dialog, typed-confirmation delete; saves return the stored document. Admin copy is English only.
- **D56 — Security headers as built** (active). `src/lib/security/headers.ts` is dependency-free (imported by `next.config.ts`); common headers on **every** path; HSTS `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains` (no `preload` until the owner confirms) only for https site URLs (otherwise WebKit upgrades localhost). `experimental.sri` stays off (stamps only some Turbopack chunks, all same-origin). zod is not imported by client code (v4 probes `new Function('')`, a CSP violation, and bloats the bundle). `security.spec.ts` records `securitypolicyviolation`: zero allowed.
- **D72 — AI logo search: provider abstraction, fallback chain, SVG-only import** (active; 2026-11-06). Typing a technology name in the admin should suggest importable logos. `AiProvider` has one file per provider (`vercel-gateway.ts`, `openrouter.ts`) over a shared OpenAI-compatible fetch (no SDK, D7/D26); `FallbackAiProvider` skips unconfigured providers and moves on after any failure. Logos are stored as sanitized path data (D37), so only SVG works and the schema is unchanged. Candidates must be on an allowlisted host, download and pass `sanitizeSvg` before the UI shows them. Only the technology name leaves the server. Caches and rate limits are per instance (as login). No model ids are defaulted because free availability changes.
- **D73 — Admin-initiated remote icon fetch (narrow exception to "no server fetches")** (active; 2026-11-06). The rule that the server never fetches supplied URLs would block D72 and manual URL import. Exception: only from `POST /admin/api/logo-search` and `/logo-import` (session, same-origin, rate limited); https on 443 only, no credentials, DNS-resolved addresses must be public, manual redirects (3 hops, rechecked), 5 s, 100 KB cap, SVG content only, then `sanitizeSvg`. AI-proposed URLs also need an allowlisted host. Never at render time or from stored content. Residual risk: DNS rebinding between lookup and connect, accepted for a single-owner endpoint.

## Tech cloud

- **D13 — Technology icon resolution** (active, audited). Simple Icons first, `devicon-plain` (single-tone) second, monogram last; only plain `path/circle/ellipse/rect/polygon` geometry (no gradients, transforms, strokes, `evenodd`). Overrides: TanStack Query → `reactquery`; Swagger/OpenAPI → `swagger`; Pub/Sub → `googlepubsub`; BigQuery → `googlebigquery`; Java, AWS, Zustand, gRPC, AngularJS from devicon-plain. Monograms (pinned via `monogram` field): SQL, Excel/Power Query (`XL`), Power BI (`BI`), SharePoint, VBA, VS Code, GPT. Re-run `icons:audit` (also writes `.cache/icons-audit.html`) after changing technologies.
- **D22 — Nav indicator without Motion `layoutId`** (active). `layoutId` needs `domMax` (~10 KB gzip). The pill is positioned from the active link's box with a CSS transition.
- **D37 — Tech cloud follows the `techs-cloud` prototype** (active; reworked by D38–D45). Port the feel and the set, not the runtime: geoid radii (0.8–1.2×), latitude spin, float, radial mask, yaw-only drag with inertia, hover slowdown + name over the mark. ~96 technologies in 7 categories, priorities 1–3 (phones render ≤ 2, ~49). Full-colour marks resolved server-side into on-origin files (amends D13 for this surface); dark marks are lifted to `#e8eaf0` when luminance < 0.25. Kept from the spec: List view as no-JS/reduced-motion default, sphere `aria-hidden`, `touch-action: pan-y`, rAF only while visible, no React state per frame. The prototype's CDN `<img>`s can't be used (no third-party requests).
- **D38 — Full-bleed stage** (amended by D40).
- **D39 — 7th category `ai`** (active). "AI agents & tooling" / "Agentes de IA e ferramentas" holds Cursor, VS Code, Claude, GPT, Gemini, Lovable. The `development` dataset needed those documents or the chip stays hidden (`count === 0`).
- **D40 — Rectangular stage** (active). `h-[80svh] w-full`; projection uses independent X/Y radii (0.4 × width/height) and Z from `min(w,h)`; the glow uses `rounded-[50%]`; chips are a toolbar (`aria-pressed`, names include the count).
- **D41 — Min height 600px** (active). Added to `geoidStageClassName` (live and placeholders).
- **D42 — No Cloud|List toggle** (active). The geoid shows after hydration unless `useReducedMotionPreference()` (reduced motion or Pause animations); SSR/no-JS/crash render the List.
- **D43 — Centered chips** (active). **D44 — Filter mutes unmatched icons** (active): ×0.08 opacity, no pointer events; exclusive filtering. **D45 — Dim eases in rAF** (active): lerp factor 0.12 (~250 ms); depth opacity stays a direct write.
- **D59 — Logos as cached files; document weight** (active). `/tech-icons/<hash>.svg` (hash = two FNV-1a passes over viewBox+paths) is `immutable`, only visible technologies resolve, `?fill=<6 hex>` colours it; List view draws the same file as a CSS mask. Project detail keeps a few inline icons. JetBrains Mono not preloaded. Detail cover uses `preload` + `fetchPriority="high"` (`priority` is deprecated). Home HTML went 690 → 278 KB (47 KB gzip).
- **D66 — Frame-time scaling and drag model** (active; from `techs-cloud` PR #1). `k = min(gap, 50 ms)/16.67 ms` for spin, easing, dim and friction; pointer travel accumulated per frame; stationary-hold decay; stage size from ResizeObserver only; loop stops when hidden/off-screen/zero-sized. Pure math in `src/lib/tech-cloud/motion.ts` (tested at 60/90/120/144 Hz). Not transposed: `touch-action: none` (the geoid sits in a scrolling page).

## Home, hero, header

- **D17 — Smaller interpretations** (active). Primary button = solid `text-1` background with `bg-0` label; skip link reads "Skip to main content"; experience VFS slugs derive from `company` (numeric suffix on collision); dev cookie is `jm_session`; admin `lang="en"`; `/dev/ui` calls `notFound()` in production.
- **D46 — Home order** (superseded in part by D69: the Quote band is gone). Hero → Quote → About → Stack → Work → Résumé → Contact → Recommended. Nav: About · Stack · Work · Résumé · Contact. Résumé uses native radio tabs (CSS `:has()` shows the matching panel; works without JS); every job is a `<details>`, current role open; CTAs are the locale PDF and the owner's LinkedIn. `collapsedByDefault` stays in the schema but no longer drives the UI.
- **D47 — Hero art direction** (headline/rotating-word parts superseded by D67). Optional `photoLg` (3:4, alpha preserved); `getImageProps` + `<picture>` (`min-width: 1024px` → lg) so one image downloads; OG/JSON-LD keep the square photo.
- **D48 — About absorbs Summary** (active). One `#about`: bio left, up to 4 metrics as a 2×2 tile right from `lg`; `#summary` stays on the stats list; facts (`location`, `spokenLanguages`, `focus`) are terminal-only.
- **D67 — Name as the hero title, selectable font, header links** (active). H1 = `displayName` on one line. `heroHeadline` and `rotatingWords` are gone; `heroLead` ≤ 120 chars (so the home meta description uses `meta.siteDescription`, intended). `profile.titleFont` picks one of ten Google fonts via `next/font/google` (self-hosted at build, `preload: false`, each defines `--font-title-<id>`, only the chosen file is fetched). **The hero must not import `styles/title-fonts.ts`** (Turbopack splits `@font-face` into a render-blocking stylesheet that cost `/pt` ~0.03 Lighthouse performance). `FitTitle` measures and sets `--fit`; never wraps or clips. Featured-link placement `hero` → `header` (max three icons from `md`). Terminal button is primary with a visible label. The header wordmark hides while the hero is in view. Migration steps: [SANITY.md](./SANITY.md#migration-2026-11-d67).
- **D69 — Quote band removed** (active; 2026-11-04, owner request). The "Quotes of the moment" band, `profile.featuredQuote` (schema, repository, Sanity schema/query/mapper, fixtures), its admin fields and the `quote` messages are deleted. Existing Sanity documents may still hold the field; reads ignore it. The hero scroll cue now targets `#about`.

## Window manager and terminal

- **D49 — Window manager** (entry-point rule superseded by D50). Pure geometry in `src/lib/window-manager/geometry.ts`; gestures write to the DOM in rAF and commit on release; `Esc`/`pointercancel` reverts (WCAG 2.5.2); open/minimize/close are CSS transitions (~280 ms); persistence in `sessionStorage['jm.window.<id>.v1']` (zod-validated; a closed window isn't persisted).
- **D50 — Public terminal** (active). Live entry points: header button, footer hint, dock chip, one-time "type help" hint (1.5 s, once per session, never with reduced motion). Pure core in `src/lib/terminal`; the React shell is one `next/dynamic` chunk; big `terminal` namespace is a lazy catalog, small `window` namespace ships with the provider; unit tests use a translator that throws on missing keys. `execute()` is an async generator; unsupported shell syntax (`; & | > < * ? $`) comes back as output; Ctrl+C aborts cleanly. Session in `sessionStorage['jm.terminal.v1']` (≤ 300 blocks, 100 history lines). Tab never traps focus on an empty line. Multi-line paste runs the first line. `git log --oneline` hashes are FNV-1a of `slug:title:start`.
- **D63 — Snap preview** (active). One always-mounted `aria-hidden` element written straight to the DOM; hysteresis 8 px to arm / 32 px to release (`snapSideAt(pointer, viewport, armed)`); CSS transitions only.
- **D64 — Easter eggs** (active). `fortune`, `cowsay`, `matrix` (4 s CSS rain behind `actions.effect`, skipped for reduced motion), `ping`, `ssh`, `sudo`, `rm`, `vim`/`vi`/`nano`/`emacs`. All local and harmless; none may mention the admin, `su`, sessions or passwords (unit-tested). Lives in the lazy terminal chunk (≤ 20 KB).

## Quality, tests, CI

- **D12 — `text-3` is `#828a9f`** (active; was `#7a8196`, 4.44:1 on `surface-2`). A unit test covers every foreground token × surface (≥ 4.5:1; `text-1`/`text-2` on `bg-0` ≥ 7:1). Don't put `text-3` on new surfaces without extending it.
- **D23 — axe runs on Chromium projects only** (active). It hangs in WebKit `page.evaluate` here. Scans of animated UI wait for `getAnimations({ subtree: true })`.
- **D31 — OG images via `next/og`** (active). One renderer (`src/lib/seo/og-image.tsx`), Geist TTF (Satori can't read woff2), per-segment `opengraph-image.tsx` + `twitter-image.tsx`.
- **D32 — `check:seo` starts its own server** (active) on `SEO_PORT` (3101) unless `SEO_BASE_URL` is set; canonicals asserted against `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
- **D36 — axe ignores pending reveals; Playwright serializes under load** (active). Pending `Reveal` nodes stay `opacity: 0` and are excluded from axe; screenshots emulate reduced motion; 2 workers, 60 s timeout; `force` clicks on WebKit language/motion tests.
- **D58 — Bundle budgets as enforced** (active; deviates from spec). Framework floor is 135.5 KB; Home budget 195 KB (measured ~191), projects/detail 190, others 185; lazy terminal ≤ 20, secret ≤ 3, sphere ≤ 10. `check:bundle` also fails on terminal/secret code in a public first load, the admin path in any non-admin chunk, and server-only names/values in client files. Reaching 150 KB would mean dropping Motion and next-intl from the client.
- **D60 — Lighthouse CI thresholds as enforced** (active; deviates from spec). Simulated LCP counts all first-load JS before first paint (observed LCP ~150 ms, simulated 2.8–3.5 s). 3 runs per URL (Home, `/projects`, a detail page, both locales) with `bun x @lhci/cli@0.15.1` (kept out of `bun audit`). Fail on accessibility < 1, SEO < 1, best practices < 0.95, CLS > 0.05, performance < 0.85, LCP > 3.8 s, TBT > 350 ms. Under WSL it leaves `C:\Users\…\lighthouse.*` folders; delete them.
- **D61 — Cross-browser smoke and visual baselines** (active). Firefox project runs the public specs; admin specs stay on Chromium/WebKit/mobile. Two per-browser adjustments: Firefox empties `clipboardData` on synthetic paste (that test is skipped) and keeps focus on the last tab stop when Tab leaves the page. Visual snapshots (hero and first card at 375/768/1440, Chromium, reduced motion, `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01`) run in CI and locally with `VISUAL=1`; the manual workflow regenerates baselines. CI runners are `ubuntu-24.04`.

## Analytics

- **D68 — Vercel Web Analytics** (active; 2026-11-02, previously an unnumbered section). `@vercel/analytics` is mounted in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`; cookieless, served from `/_vercel/insights/*` on the site origin (CSP unchanged, no banner); `beforeSend` drops `/admin` URLs. `src/lib/analytics.ts` wraps `track` with a typed event list: `email_click`, `resume_open` (locale), `external_link` (host) via the delegated `ClickTracker`; `email_copy`, `language_switch` (to), `terminal_open` directly. Properties are never user input; terminal commands are never tracked. **Owner step:** enable Web Analytics on the Vercel project.

## Spec contradictions and how they were resolved

## Risks (open and closed)

- **R1 — Status codes under streaming.** Closed by D1b.
- **R2 — next-intl + root params.** Closed: `/en` and `/pt` build as static.
- **R3 — Vercel 4.5 MB request body.** Closed: 4 MB limits, 411 without `Content-Length`. Raising them would need client-side downscaling or a chunked/Sanity-direct upload.
- **R4 — Devicon single-tone legibility.** Mitigated by the contact sheet and the monogram fallback.
- **R5 — Lighthouse performance on mobile.** **Open**, accepted via floors (D60). The owner decides whether to fund deeper work (e.g. moving hero animations and the window shell off the initial hydration path).
- **R6 — rAF loops on hidden routes.** Mitigated: loops stop on visibility, intersection and zero size (D66).
- **R7 — Admin 404 timing.** Accepted: JWT verification is microseconds; the login delay is the real equalizer.
- **R8 — Server Action origin behind proxies.** Self-hosting behind a host-rewriting proxy needs `serverActions.allowedOrigins`.
- **R9 — Bun runtime on Vercel is beta** (D24). **Open.**
- **R10 — Per-instance login rate limiter.** **Open**, known gap (D51).

## Assumptions

- Production is `https://juliolmuller.com` (D70) and staging is `https://next-juliolmuller.vercel.app` (branch `next`). Previews send `noindex` (`VERCEL_ENV !== 'production'`).
- Sanity project `njcnsmax` (org `ow3ahfjbr`) with private `production` and `development` datasets; the owner creates tokens (CI runs on fixtures).
- HSTS `preload` is not added until the owner confirms.
- GitHub Actions is available; Lighthouse CI uses `@lhci/cli` against `next start`, no LHCI server.
- Real résumé, photo and content are entered later through the admin; nothing real is seeded.
